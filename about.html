    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here at Try New Coffee, you'll find a collection of in depth profiles for
      coffees from all over the world. We provide all of the details that an
      experienced coffee drinker could ask for, and also discuss who we think
      will enjoy the particular coffee the most. For more on our coffee
      profiling system, check out Coffee Profiles Explained. We offer a series
      of best coffee lists that contain groups of related coffee
      recommendations. We think that this is a great way to talk about a
      specific type of coffee or origin in detail. If you're a big fan of a
      particular type of coffee, you may be able to find a similar, but new
      option to try! We also have a Q & A section where we discuss anything and
      everything related to coffee. If you think we've left out an absolute
      must-try coffee, please don't hesitate to Contact Us. We're always open to
      be on the receiving end of coffee recommendations! We also inform about
      the roaster of the beans, and give some background information about the
      reputation of the region that the beans are from. This will help you
      choose a new coffee that is perfect for you.

    <p><strong>With each profile, we aim to say:</strong></p>
    <p><em><strong> We like this coffee, and this is why we think you will too!</em></strong></p>
