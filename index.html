      Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical
      evergreen coffee plant of African origin. Coffee is one of the three
      most-popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of
      the most-profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis
      for an endless array of beverages, its popularity is mainly attributed to
      its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid
      present in coffee.

    <p style="width: 70%;">
      French roast coffee is a style of coffee characterized by beans that have
      been roasted almost to the point of burning. The resulting beverage is
      nearly always very dark in color, and has a distinctive caramelized taste.
      In many places, French roast is the darkest roast available. Leaving beans
      in the fire for about a minute longer yields Italian or Spanish roast,
      both of which are right on the brink of incineration. Coffee lovers who
      enjoy a dark brew often choose French roast in part because of its easy
      availability, but also because it often has more of a coffee flavor than
      Italian or Spanish options.

    <h2>Columbia Roast</h2>

    <p style="width: 70%;">
      Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green
      coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what
      produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee
      beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher
      levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been
      roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard
      and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.
